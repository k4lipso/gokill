            DISCORDIAN PUBLIC LICENSE 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, USAGE AND MODIFICATION 

  0. There is no license but the discordian public license.
     There is no original work but the original work.
     Every modified version of the original work shall be
     distributed under the discordian public license.

  1. Work published under the discordian public license should
     always use the discordian document numbering system
     and shall never be deterministic.

  2. Before users are allowed to use software published under the
     discordian public license they need to go out on a friday
     while using only free software on a linux device for a full day;
     this Devotive Ceremony to Remonstrate against the modern
     Paganisms of the Day: amazonian buying spiritualism
     (don't go out on a friday, everything should be delivered
     to your place), Apple's status symbolism (dont use anything else
     than Apple products, otherwise you are worth nothing),
     unlimited trust towards google (don't use anything else than
     Google services and products, put all your pictures and
     documents into their cloud), social craving for recognition
     (don't leave the house without updating your facebook,
     instagram or whatsapp status), Church of Microsoft
     (only use Microsoft products and software, everything else
     is just too complicated) and of the discordian aversion
     to centrality (never use properitary services and never use
     any kind of centralized services that you dont host yourself)

  3. Users of this software should never use properitary services again
     and should never use any kind of centralized services
     that they dont host themselfes.

  4. Rules 0, 1, 2 and 3 do not apply to anything that is published
     under the discordian public license.

IT IS SO WRITTEN! SO BE IT. HAIL DISCORDIA! PROSECUTORS WILL BE TRANSGRESSICUTED.
